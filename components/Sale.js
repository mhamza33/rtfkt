          We want to make the pre-sale as affordable as possible to reward our
          collectors; hence we have <br />
          <br />
          chosen a price point of 0.05Îž for the RTFKT pre-sale. <br />
          <br />1 qualified RTFKT NFT gives 3 reserved opportunities to buy into
          the 48 hr pre-sale <br />
          <br />
          (excluding the Metakey: Edition Two RTFKT version that gives only 1
          opportunity in pre-sale)
